I didn’t get into cybersecurity from a textbook or a classroom. It started when I bought Bitcoin at around $1,700 and later watched it shoot up toward $75K. When you see something you own jump like that, you start thinking a lot differently about security. Around the same time, Vault 7 and the Snowden leaks hit, and that flipped a switch for me. I realized how exposed people really are if they don’t understand what’s going on behind the scenes.

I didn’t start studying cybersecurity just to protect my crypto. It hooked me because it matched how I already think — pay attention, understand the system, find the weak points, and stay ahead of the problem. My military background trained me to operate that way, and cybersecurity became the perfect extension of that mindset. Once I stepped into it, it stopped being about Bitcoin and became something I genuinely wanted to master.
The NCL CTFs were a different pace from the lab environments I build for myself. You don’t get unlimited time or perfect conditions, you get pressure, a clock, and problems that don’t tell you what they want.
It forced me to stay calm, organized, and adaptable. Every challenge hit a different part of the cybersecurity stack: recon, exploitation, cracking, logs, forensics — the whole spectrum. The experience showed me where my strengths are, where I need more reps, and confirmed that I’m moving in the right direction technically.

Individual Game – Fall 2025 (75th Percentile)

My strong areas lined up with how I naturally operate:

Scanning & Recon – full completion, fast solves

Web Exploitation – validation bypasses, SQL injection

Enumeration & Exploitation – command injection, stack work

Password Cracking – NTLM, SHA-1, PDF cracking, rule-based attacks

Team Game – Fall 2025 (80th Percentile)

Best contributions:

Password Cracking – high accuracy across multiple hash types

Enumeration & Exploitation – reverse engineering + mainframe challenges

Forensics – image recovery, dump analysis, patching work

One moment that stood out to me during the CTF was dealing with a restricted environment where none of the usual utilities I rely on were available. I had to work through an SSH session with minimal tooling, and the challenge involved analyzing data in a format I couldn’t directly view.

Instead of stopping, I adapted. I extracted the raw data in a portable form, moved it out of the restricted environment, and rebuilt it so I could analyze it with external tools. That workaround let me continue the investigation and complete the task despite the limitations.

The experience reinforced something important: even when the environment is locked down, you can still make progress if you understand how data is structured and you're willing to think creatively.
